Flag Semaphore is telemetry system conveying information at a distance by means of visual signals with hand-held flags, rods, disks, paddles, or occasionally bare or gloved hands. Information is encoded by the position of the flags where it is read when the flag is in a fixed position. Semaphores were adopted and widely used in the maritime world in the 19th century. Despite modern alternative electronic communication means, flag semaphore is use a must learnt subject by all navies and mariners around the world.
